# shopping_covid19

This analysis is based on a data collection during the first 6 months of the Covid-19 pandemic in the USA. Via MTurk we sampled 25 Americans every 25 days (never the same person) and assessed the same survey via formr to observe changes in the pattern. Following careful data cleaning and screening out probably dishonest people we obtained a final sample of 1430 participants. The project was supported by the Humboldt University of Berlin. Data analysis and project leading by Aniko Maraz, PhD. Further input by Eva Katzinger (MA student at Humboldt University of Berlin) and Sunghwan Yi, PhD (University of Guelph, Canada).

Paper 1 is about the analysis of excessive behaviours during the time of data collection. Here we found that the frequency of self-reported excessive behaviours (shopping (compulsive buying), alcohol, smoking, legal substances, illegal substances, gambling, gaming and overeating) increased during the first six months of the pandemic (especially compulsive buying and gaming), although itâ€™s relevance to distress is not yet clear. The preprint will soon be available and published here. 
 
Paper 2 focuses on compulsive buying tendencies and its relationship to income, social status and credit status during the pandemic. This paper is currently under analysis. 

Paper 3 explores the role of coping in the relationship between distress and compulsive buying. 

All 3 papers are currently in preparation and will be published in scientific journals when ready.

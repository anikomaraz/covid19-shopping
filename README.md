# Shopping and other addictions during Covid-19: an academic project

There comes the time in every **lucky** scientists' life when she has a one-and-only opportunity to test and apply the knowledge she researched (in theory) for years including my PhD dissertation. For me this opportunity was the beginning of the Covid-19 in the spring of 2020: to observe the prevalence trends of shopping (and other substance and non-substance) addictions under distress. The project was supported by the Humboldt University of Berlin. I lead this project, and did most of the data analysis and publication and was supported by my colleagues Eva Katzinger (MA student at Humboldt University of Berlin) and Sunghwan Yi, PhD (University of Guelph, Canada).

## Method
This analysis is based on a data collection during the first 6 months of the Covid-19 pandemic in the USA. Via MTurk we sampled 25 Americans every 25 days (never the same person) and assessed the same survey via formr to observe changes in the pattern. Following careful data cleaning and screening out probably dishonest people we obtained a final sample of 1430 participants.   

In order to comply with the Open Science Principles the protocol (and the study) was preregistered before data collection under the following link: https://osf.io/m5kw9

You can also find all data and scripts of analysis on the OSF and in this repo. 

## Output
*Paper 1* is about the analysis of **excessive behaviours** during the time of data collection. Here we found that the frequency of self-reported excessive behaviours (shopping (compulsive buying), alcohol, smoking, legal substances, illegal substances, gambling, gaming and overeating) increased during the first six months of the pandemic (especially compulsive buying and gaming), although itâ€™s relevance to distress is not yet clear. The final paper (including beautiful visualisations!) is available in the Journal of Behavioral Addictions [under this link](https://akjournals.com/view/journals/2006/10/4/article-p912.xml?body=pdf-23898).  
 
*Paper 2* focuses on compulsive buying tendencies and its relationship to income, social status and credit status during the pandemic. Our findings are the first in the scientific literature using a long-term design to find a surprisingly strong correspondance between distress and compulsive buying tendencies. This exciting paper is also already [available](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9109632/pdf/jba-11-088.pdf). 
 
*Note: the data collection platform and automation was written in formr, and R framework. Data were analysed and visualised using R.*
